## Overview

Sparky Platform is a robust backend API designed to power a modern social networking experience. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it provides a solid foundation for handling user authentication, post management, social interactions, and real-time notifications. This project emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and security, providing a performant and reliable backend infrastructure.

## Key Features

*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcryptjs for password hashing.
*   **Post Management:** Comprehensive functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts, including pagination for efficient data handling.
*   **Social Interactions:** Core social features such as following/unfollowing users, retrieving follower/following lists, and managing "sparks" (likes).
*   **Real-time Notifications:** Integrated notification system to alert users of new follows, sparks, and comments, enhancing user engagement.
*   **RESTful API:** Well-defined RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration with frontend applications.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and logging to ensure application stability and facilitate debugging.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Data Modeling:** Mongoose
*   **Authentication:** JWT, bcryptjs
*   **Environment Variables:** dotenv

## Architecture

Sparky Platform follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct components:

*   **Routes:** Define API endpoints and handle routing requests to appropriate controllers.
*   **Controllers:** Implement the application's business logic, handling requests and interacting with models.
*   **Models:** Define data schemas and interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
*   **Middlewares:** Handle authentication, authorization, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 16 or higher)
*   MongoDB (running locally or a cloud instance)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-Khaledx/sparky-platform.git`
2.  Navigate to the server directory: `cd Mohammed-Khaledx-sparky-platform/server`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4.  Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure the following environment variables:

    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/sparky_platfrom_db # Your MongoDB connection string
    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET                          # A secret key for JWT signing
    ```

### Running the Server

*   `npm start` or `yarn start` (uses nodemon for automatic restarts during development)

## API Endpoints (Examples)

*   `POST /users/register`: Register a new user.
*   `POST /users/login`: Log in an existing user.
*   `GET /users/:id`: Get user information.
*   `POST /posts`: Create a new post.
*   `GET /posts`: Get all posts (with pagination).
*   `POST /followOrUnfollow/:id/follow`: Follow a user.
*   `POST /followOrUnfollow/:id/unfollow`: Unfollow a user.
*   ... more

(Refer to the API documentation or route files for a complete list of endpoints.)

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement more advanced notification features (e.g., real-time updates using WebSockets).
*   Implement image/video upload functionality for posts.
